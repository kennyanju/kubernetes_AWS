# Kubernetes Competency Development Guide

This part of the guide covers tasks designed to help new engineers become competent in Kubernetes, focusing on the AWS cloud environment.

## 1. Understanding Kubernetes Architecture and Concepts

Research and document the components of Kubernetes architecture, including nodes, pods, services, deployments, and how they interact.

## 2. Creating and Managing Kubernetes Clusters on AWS

Set up a Kubernetes cluster using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).
  
  ```bash
  # Install AWS CLI
  curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
  unzip awscliv2.zip
  sudo ./aws/install
  
  # Install eksctl
  curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
  sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
  
  # Create an EKS cluster
  eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --region us-west-2 --nodegroup-name my-nodes --node-type t3.medium --nodes 3
  ```

## 3. Deploying Applications on Kubernetes

Deploy a simple Nginx application on your Kubernetes cluster.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: nginx-deployment
  spec:
    replicas: 2
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: nginx
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: nginx
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.14.2
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
  ```

## 4. Configuring Networking in Kubernetes

Create a Service to expose your Nginx application inside the cluster and then configure an Ingress to expose the Nginx service to the internet.

## 5. Implementing Service Discovery and Load Balancing

Implement service discovery using Kubernetes Services and set up a LoadBalancer type service to expose an application externally.

## 6. Managing Storage

Attach an AWS EBS volume to a pod in your Kubernetes cluster.

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

Set up monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana, and configure logging with Fluentd for your Kubernetes cluster.

## 8. Automating Deployment and Scaling

Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for your application based on CPU usage.

## 9. Securing the Kubernetes Cluster

Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage access to your Kubernetes resources.

## 10. Troubleshooting and Debugging

Troubleshoot a failed deployment and a service that's not accessible. Document your process and solutions.
